    Bind vs Connect, extract of 0MZ doc:

    **Why do I see different behavior when I bind a socket versus connect a socket?

    ZeroMQ creates queues per underlying connection, e.g. if your socket is
    connected to 3 peer sockets there are 3 messages queues.
    With bind, you allow peers to connect to you, thus you don't know how many
    peers there will be in the future and you cannot create the queues in advance.
    Instead, queues are created as individual peers connect to the bound socket.

    With connect, ZeroMQ knows that there's going to be at least a single peer
    and thus it can create a single queue immediately. This applies to all
    socket types except ROUTER, where queues are only created after the peer
    we connect to has acknowledge our connection.

    Consequently, when sending a message to bound socket with no peers, or a
    ROUTER with no live connections, there's no queue to store the message to.

    **When should I use bind and when connect?

    As a very general advice: use bind on the most stable points in your
    architecture and connect from the more volatile endpoints. For
    request/reply the service provider might be point where you bind and the
    client uses connect. Like plain old TCP.

    If you can't figure out which parts are more stable (i.e. peer-to-peer)
    think about a stable device in the middle, where boths sides can connect to.

    The question of bind or connect is often overemphasized. It's really just
    a matter of what the endpoints do and if they live long â€” or not. And this
    depends on your architecture. So build your architecture to fit your
    problem, not to fit the tool.
